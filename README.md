The program's purpose (project 3) is to track bought orders from Corner Grocery stores from open to close. What I did well is create a header, body and conclusion through c++ statements such as #include to support the coding being inserted through the entire code. What was most challenging in this project is whitespace. Initially when the code ran through, there were no spaces between any of the words so I had to keep on editing where I thought spacing needed to go. Skills from this project that I used that can be put into other projects or work is analysis. For example, examining your work before you initiate code because some errors can be fixed without using ignore or going around the problem.
